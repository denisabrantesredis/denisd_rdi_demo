Some colours may initially transfer when in dry or wet contact with light coloured fabrics or upholstery. This transfer will reduce after a few washes but we recommend that you wash the product separately for the first few washes. <br /><br />This earthy shirt by fabindia for men is perfect for the artsy intellectual. The superior comfort afforded by the pure cotton fabric and traditional yet fashionable hand block print makes this a wardrobe essential. Hand block printing is one of the three main techniques used for fabric decoration. Skilled artisans carve the required design into hard wood to make the blocks, which are the essential tools for printing. These blocks are dipped sequentially into a dye bath and stamped onto the fabric with skilled precision. A separate block is used for each colour, some fabrics may have as many as 500 block repeats per metre! Pair this unique piece with colourful cotton trousers to go all out and make a colour block statement. For the more conservative, pair it with simple form fitting denims and sandals.<br /><br /><strong>Model statistics</strong><br />The product is a size 40 on a model of height 6' and shoulders 18\"</p>", "discount_pct": 0, "inventoryCount": 84}, {"id": 13866, "price": 159.9, "discountedPrice": 159.9, "articleNumber": "1SL33202", "productDisplayName": "Scullers Men Check Red Shirts", "variantName": "Check", "catalogAddDate": 1431586973, "brandName": "SCULLERS", "ageGroup": "Adults-Men", "gender": "Men", "baseColour": "Red", "fashionType": "Fashion", "season": "Fall", "year": "2011", "vat": 5.5, "rating": 2, "displayCategories": "Casual Wear", "image_48x64": "../assets/products/shirts/13866_48X64.jpg", "image_1080X1440": "../assets/products/shirts/13866_1080X1440.jpg", "image_150X200": "../assets/products/shirts/13866_150X200.jpg", "image_360X480": "../assets/products/shirts/13866_360X480.jpg", "masterCategory": "Apparel", "subCategory": "Topwear", "articleType": "Shirts", "flag_fragile": "false", "flag_tryandbuy": "true", "flag_return": "true", "flag_exchange": "true", "flag_pickup": "true", "productDescriptors": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Composition</strong><br />Red and white checked shirt with a hint of brown, made of 100% cotton, that has full length buttoned placket, long sleeves with buttoned cuffs and with mid-sleeve button,&nbsp; pocket on the left chest, and brand embroidery above the left pocket<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Fitting</strong><br />Slim<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Wash care</strong><br />only hand wash in cold water using a mild detergent<br />Do not wring or bleach<br />Flat dry in shade<br />Warm iron<br />&nbsp;<br />Checks that add immense style to your casual look is what scullers brings into your life.

These reebok ZigDhoni shoes dedicated to the captain of the Indian cricket Team who led the nation to an ICC World Cup victory this year are Reebok&rsquo;s most technically advanced training shoes. The ZigTech range allows key leg muscles to strain less so that you can do more with that energy. Using a patented sole technology, Reebok&rsquo;s ZigTech model of shoes conserve and return energy offering a soft and springy ride. The zigs in these shoes absorb vibrations from the impact and take that energy around to return them to the runner in the form of a quiet, smooth springy effect. Promising mush lesser muscle activation, this springy move allows the wearer to run longer.<br /><br /><strong>Invisible force trailing along</strong><br /><br />The newest of running and cross training shoes from Reebok, the shoe is created with a technology the stretches out a little to accommodate those with wider feet; but on the whole, it&rsquo;s created for a snug Fit and in a true to size format. The Reebok Zig range of shoes is created with a zig zag outsole made of carbon rubber heel. The Zig technology absorbs impact during initial heel strike and sends a wave of momentum along the entire length of the foot, propelling the individual forward, adding greater traction. Such has been the propulsion factor that many sportspersons have actually claimed that they&rsquo;ve felt some invisible force pushing them forward.<br /><br /><strong>Substantial sole for stable runs</strong><br /><br />Created with a lightweight fabric upper, there is ample ventilation for the feet keeping the feet dry and comfortable even during a heavy round of exercise and training.

The uppers are constructed using synthetic overlays to ensure a lockdown Fit. Added to this is a lightly padded tongue and collar that ensures a comfortable, snug fit, while the lace-up system provides an even better snug and supportive fit. The lacing system is integrated with Nike&rsquo;s revolutionary Flywire technology with its high strength threadwork, like that of cables used in suspension bridges, constructed exactly at those places where the foot needs that extra support.<br />Run on air even on rock<br /><br />The forefoot inner sleeve is seamless and has an underlay support frame for that extra stability and comfort. The insole of the Nike Air Max Trainer Excel shoe has a textile lining that fits snugly around the foot, enhancing shock absorption and keeping the feet safe from impact. The shock absorption technology in the Nike Air Max Trainer Excel has a low profile phylon midsole that is employed with a 180&deg; Max Air unit to provide optimal cushioning and impact protection. The comfort factor doesn&rsquo;t end just here. The phylite midsole and outsole are fused to reduce the overall weight.<br /><br />The outsole of the Nike Air Max Trainer Excel is constructed with siped flex grooves on the forefoot to provide that ultimate multi-directional flexibility, while the strategically placed rubber pods on the outsole enhance traction and durability, making this rubber outsole engineered shoe an absolute pleasure to wear during training sessions.<br /><br /><strong>Upper</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mesh upper with supportive overlays for breathability and lockdown fit</li>\n<li>Lightly padded collar and tongue</li>\n<li>Textile lining with a cushioned footbed for added comfort</li>\n<li>Ultra-lightweight Flywire bundles are integrated with the lacing system for extra support</li>\n<li>Internal seamless forefoot inner sleeve</li>\n<li>Internal underlay support frame</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Midsole</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Internal underlay support frame</li>\n<li>Low-profile Phylon midsole with 180&deg; visible Max Air sole unit for optimal cushioning and impact absorption</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Outsole</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Siped forefoot flex grooves for ultimate multi-directional flexibility</li>\n<li>Strategically placed rubber pods in the outsole for traction and durability</li>\n<li>Rubber outsole with enhanced traction patterns for better surface grip</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Wash care</strong><br />1.

Offering soft cushioning and support with every stride, the nike Lunarswift+ features a LunarLite cushioning system that ensures a springy effect for the feet.<br /><br />The Nike Lunarswift+ range of shoes a low profile midsole that ensures a firmer feel to the underfoot. It&rsquo;s a highly recommended shoe for underpronators and overpronators with ample cushioning and stability provided in the medial and lateral side of the shoe.<br /><strong><br />Breezy touch to snug shoes</strong><br /><br />With a stitchless upper, Nike Lunarswift+ shoes reduce irritation to the feet and enhance the comfort factor. The upper of these shoes are constructed using lightweight synthetic mesh and synthetic overlays ensuring ample ventilation for the feet, keeping them dry and comfortable even during long runs. To test the breathability aspect, wear really thin socks and move around in the Nike Lunarswift+ and feel the breeze moving in and out. Added to this is a robust heel counter that provides an absolutely snug and secure Fit to the rearfoot.<br /><strong><br />Adapts to the runner's needs</strong><br /><br />Light in weight and weighing just about 306 grams, this range of shoes are employed with Lunarlon cushioning system in the midsole that is made up of a soft, resilient foam core. This is encased in a supportive foam carrier ensuring a lightweight blend of plush cushioning and springy response. This support platform is dynamic enough to respond to the runner&rsquo;s changing needs. It adopts to the wearer&rsquo;s stride through each run giving the right amount of support and stability.<br /><br />No wonder overpronators prefer the Nike Lunarswift+ as the wedged carrier foam in the Lunarlon system limits excessive pronation, without adding weight or stiffness of a traditional medial post. When it comes to neutral pronators, this pronation control feature is not activated. For such runners, the dynamic support platform enhances cushioning, converting this same shoe into a neutral running shoe.<br /><strong><br />Stay safe in the dark</strong><br /><br />The outsole of the Nike Lunarswift+ has flex grooves along its length and breadth ensuring flexibility in every stride. Constructed with an outsole using environmentally preferred rubber and a waffle pattern outsole, the shoe is absolutely high on traction and durability. Added to these features are the reflective elements used in the shoe to ensure that you are visible even when running in low visibility conditions, keeping you safe.<br /><br />Belonging to the Nike+ range, the Nike Lunarswift+ is compatible with all Nike+ products and actually talks to your iPod nano and other compatible gauging devices.
